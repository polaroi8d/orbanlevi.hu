				I am a software developer and product manager from Hungary. Currently, I work as a
				co-founder at dyrector.io. As a co-founder, my daily tasks fall somewhere on the scale
				between an engineering manager and a product manager. Based on my previous experiences, I
				have a more backend-oriented development background. I have worked on large enterprise
				systems where we used Java and the Spring Boot framework. After that, I started working more
				on the product side, managing multiple projects as a product manager who tries to bring the
				whole project together, working closely with developers and designers.
			</p>
			<p class="pt-2">
				Due to my experiences, I have been able to contribute to both sides with actual work when
				needed. I have generally worked in smaller companies, so the roles were often blurred, and
				as a proactive person, I always approached tasks with the goal of solving them as quickly
				and as qualitatively as possible. Therefore, I have experience in many aspects and have seen
				a lot.
			</p>
			<p class="pt-2">
				In recent years, I have also been close to cloud technologies, mainly handling cloud tasks
				in Azure for large UK client, but I am also familiar with AWS and GCP. I enjoy creating new
				things, solving problems, and working with people. This led me to identify myself more as an
				Engineering Manager today beside that I'm still love coding.

			<h2 class="text-xl my-4">TLDR;</h2>
			<p class="text-gray-400">
				Regrettably, one aspect of my extensive experience throughout my career is that I
				consistently transitioned between various technology stacks. I worked for companies where
				deep knowledge wasn't crucial, but problem-solving ability was. This prevented me from
				gaining deep expertise. I consider myself a generalist, someone who has seen a lot, capable
				of examining and solving problems from multiple perspectives, even with the involvement of
				external help. I'm not afraid of new things; I love all aspects of IT, whether it's
				maintaining client relationships, solving people's problems, discussing and solving
				programming or infrastructure issues.
