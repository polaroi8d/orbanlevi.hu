## About

Being a young IT student, I have the chance to create things which could change people's everyday lives. For me there was only one way when choosing a career: to learn a profession which is about constant development and momentum and in which my own ideas can be used to help others. With my individuality, I would like to change the stereotypes in the world in connection with informatics. I am open to everything that is new and that can bring changes..
